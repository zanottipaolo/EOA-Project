      This project was developed for the Economics and Business Organization
      exam @ UniBg. Its purpose is to give the user a clear view of corporate
      financial statements, specifically the balance sheet and income statement.
      Its operation is very simple: just go and load one item at a time,
      indicating the value of the transaction and its category. Automatically
      the balance sheet will be updated and once finished it will be possible to
      download it in PDF format. <br />
      For the part of privacy and liability see the <a
        href='/policy'
        class='text-teal-500 hover:text-teal-600 transition-colors'>Policy</a
      > page.
