      This project was developed for the Economics and Business Organization
      exam @ UniBg. Its purpose is to give the user a clear view of corporate
      financial report, specifically the balance sheet and income statement.
      Its operation is very simple: just go and load one item at a time,
      indicating the value of the transaction and its category. Automatically
      the financial report will be updated and once finished it will be possible to
      download it in PDF format. <br />
      For the part of privacy and liability see the <a

      > page.
